## Project Files

### **Problem 1 — Max-Flow Reduction for Cloud Task Assignment**
**Source File:** `cloud.py`  
This script builds a bipartite flow network between tasks and servers, runs Dinic’s algorithm, and generates:
- Runtime vs number of tasks/servers plot  
- Runtime vs number of edges plot  
- Log–log runtime scaling plot  

---

### **Problem 2 — NP-Hard Problem: Multiple Sequence Alignment**
**Source File:** `np_hard.py`  
This script implements:
- Progressive alignment heuristic  
- Pairwise scoring  
- DP-based alignment routines  
- Runtime experiments for scaling  
- MSA score evaluation plots
